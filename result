Dear respected Sir/Madam,

The leaked hashes use MD5 hashing algorithm, which according to my observation is providing very little protection in case of database leaking.
The hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-family of algorithms are the standard one's but not that strong.
After trying to crack the passwords I came across certain drawbacks of company's policy.
1.	The passwords were using very common combinations and there was no specific rules on their creation.
2.	The length was short which in case of cracking could be an advantage for the hackers.
3.	Salting was not implemented as it creates a strong hash value.
4.	Strong hashing algorithms were not used.


The changes I would suggest in the password policy are:

1.	Creating combination of letters, numbers and symbols is the best approach to begin with.
2.	Don't let users use common words, their username, personal information or combination of that as a password.
3.	The length should be increased.
4.	Hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2 can be used. It is ought to increase the time in cracking.


OBSERVATIONS:

Security Algorithm used : MD5
