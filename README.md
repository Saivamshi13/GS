# password Cracking and Security

# Overview
As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. You often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place.

What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? 

After the conducted analysis it was determined that organization uses an outdated password hashing algorithm (MD5) which offers very little protection in the event of a
password database leaking. It was also determined that the current password policy is not aligned with industry best practices allowing users to have short passwords (6
characters) and reuse usernames as part of passwords.

As a result of the analysis the following uplifts are proposed to increase the overall level of password protection:

• It is advised to educate users on creating safe and easy to remember passwords. Having a password policy requiring long passwords with a number of special characters
results in user writing passwords down or constantly resetting them. The best way to create a strong and user-friendly password is using passphrases (e.g.
my grannys chair had staples). The best way to create such passwords is to combine a couple of completely random word. It’s also advised to use some special characters
and numbers as easy to remember substitutions to expand the key space (e.g. mYgranny$cha1rhadstaples)

• Educate users on the benefits of passwords managers. Having a password manager allows having very long and completely random passwords (e.g. M>?{tk6Cfep6BrZ4J)KZWQ8j)
without the need to remember/write down. A strong passphrase is still required as a master key for to access the password manager.

#Project Report and Observations
Completing this task assigned by Goldman Sachs, MD5 and SHA were the two algorithms that I came across. Analysing the passwords and their respective security algorithms
used, I narrowed down my observations into this report.

# Project Report

Dear respected Sir/Madam,
The leaked hashes uses MD5 hashing algorithm, which according to my observation is providing very little protection in case of database leaking.
The hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-family of algorithms are the standard one's but not that strong.

After trying to crack the passwords I came across certain drawbacks of company's policy.
1. The passwords were using very common combinations and there was no specific rules on their creation.
2. The length was short which in case of cracking could be an advantage for the hackers.
3. Salting was not implemented as it creates a strong hash value.
4. Strong hashing algorithms were not used.

The changes I would suggest in the password policy are:
1. Creating combination of letters, numbers and symbols is the best approach to begin with.
2. Don't let users use common words, their username, personal information or combination of that as a password.
3. The length should be increased.
4. Hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2 can be used. It is ought to increase the time in cracking.


Thanking you,
